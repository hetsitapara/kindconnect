# KindConnect - 5-Step Learning Roadmap

## üìã Overview
**KindConnect** is a Volunteer Management System built with ASP.NET Core MVC that connects NGOs with volunteers. This roadmap will guide you through understanding the entire project systematically.

---

## üéØ STEP 1: Understand the Project Purpose & Architecture (30 mins)

### What This Project Does
- **Purpose**: Platform connecting NGOs with volunteers for community events
- **Key Features**:
  - NGOs create and manage volunteer events
  - Volunteers browse and apply to events
  - Superuser approves NGO registrations and monitors system
  - Application tracking (Pending/Approved/Rejected/Cancelled)

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 MVC
- **Authentication**: ASP.NET Core Identity
- **Database**: SQL Server with Entity Framework Core
- **Frontend**: Razor Views (server-side rendering)
- **Additional Libraries**: 
  - CsvHelper (data export)
  - iTextSharp (PDF generation)

### Architecture Pattern: MVC
```
Models/ ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Data entities (ApplicationUser, Event, NGOProfile, VolunteerApplication)
Views/ ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Razor templates for UI
Controllers/ ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Business logic and request handling
Data/ ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Database context and seeding
```

### Three User Roles
1. **Superuser** - System admin (approves NGOs, views all data)
2. **NGO** - Organization (creates events, manages applications)
3. **Volunteer** - End user (applies to events)

### üìù Action Items
- [ ] Read `README.md` and `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md`
- [ ] Review `Program.cs` to understand app startup
- [ ] Check `VolunteerManagementSystem.csproj` for dependencies
- [ ] Understand the 3 roles and their permissions

---

## üóÑÔ∏è STEP 2: Study the Data Models (45 mins)

### Core Models Location: `/Models/`

#### 1. ApplicationUser.cs
```
Extends IdentityUser (built-in ASP.NET Identity)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FirstName, LastName
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phone
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IsActive (soft delete flag)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Navigation: NGOProfile (1-to-1)
```

#### 2. NGOProfile.cs
```
One NGO profile per NGO user
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OrganizationName, Description
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Website, Address, City, State, ZipCode
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ContactEmail, ContactPhone
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LogoPath (file upload)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IsActive (approval status by Superuser)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Navigation: Events (1-to-many)
```

#### 3. Event.cs
```
Events created by NGOs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Title, Description, Category
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EventDate, StartTime, EndTime
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Venue, City, State
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MaxVolunteers (capacity)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IsPublic (visibility)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ContactEmail, ContactPhone
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IsActive (soft delete)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Computed Properties:
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IsFull (checks current vs max volunteers)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IsUpcoming (checks if event is in future)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Navigation: VolunteerApplications (1-to-many)
```

#### 4. VolunteerApplication.cs
```
Links volunteers to events
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EventId, UserId (composite unique key)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ApplicationMessage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Skills, Availability
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Status (Pending/Approved/Rejected/Cancelled)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ResponseMessage (from NGO)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AppliedAt, UpdatedAt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Navigation: Event, User
```

### Database Relationships
```
ApplicationUser (NGO) ‚îÄ‚îÄ1:1‚îÄ‚îÄ> NGOProfile
NGOProfile ‚îÄ‚îÄ1:many‚îÄ‚îÄ> Event
Event ‚îÄ‚îÄ1:many‚îÄ‚îÄ> VolunteerApplication
ApplicationUser (Volunteer) ‚îÄ‚îÄ1:many‚îÄ‚îÄ> VolunteerApplication
```

### üìù Action Items
- [ ] Read all 4 model files in `/Models/`
- [ ] Draw the entity relationship diagram on paper
- [ ] Check `/Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs` for DbContext configuration
- [ ] Review `/Data/SeedData.cs` to see sample data creation
- [ ] Look at `/Migrations/` to understand database schema

---

## üéÆ STEP 3: Explore Controllers & Business Logic (60 mins)

### Controllers Location: `/Controllers/`

#### 1. AccountController.cs (Authentication)
**Key Actions:**
- `Register` - User registration (choose NGO or Volunteer role)
- `Login` - Authentication
- `Logout` - Sign out
- `Manage` - User profile management
- **Flow**: Register ‚Üí Creates user with role ‚Üí If NGO, creates NGOProfile (pending approval)

#### 2. HomeController.cs (Public Pages)
**Key Actions:**
- `Index` - Landing page with public statistics
- `Privacy` - Privacy policy page
- **Note**: Uses `[AllowAnonymous]` for public access

#### 3. DashboardController.cs (Role-based Dashboards)
**Key Actions:**
- `Superuser` - Global stats (users, NGOs, events, applications)
- `Volunteer` - Personal stats and upcoming events
- **Authorization**: Role-specific views

#### 4. NGOProfilesController.cs (NGO Management)
**Key Actions:**
- `Create`, `Edit` - NGO profile management
- `Approve`, `Reject` - Superuser actions
- `Delete` - Soft delete (sets IsActive=false)
- **Business Rule**: NGO must be approved to create events

#### 5. EventsController.cs (Event Management)
**Key Actions:**
- `Index` - List events (filtered by role)
- `Details` - Event details with applications
- `Create`, `Edit`, `Delete` - Event CRUD (NGO only)
- `ExportEventsToPdf`, `ExportEventsToCSV` - Data export
- **Business Rules**: 
  - Only approved NGOs can create events
  - Validates dates and capacity

#### 6. VolunteerApplicationsController.cs (Applications)
**Key Actions:**
- `Apply` - Volunteer applies to event
- `Index` - Volunteer views their applications
- `Manage` - NGO views applications for their event
- `ManageAll` - NGO views all applications across events
- `Approve`, `Reject` - NGO responds to applications
- `Cancel` - Volunteer cancels their application
- **Business Rules**:
  - No duplicate applications
  - Can't apply to full events
  - Unique constraint on (EventId, UserId)

#### 7. SuperAdminController.cs (Admin Panel)
**Key Actions:**
- `Volunteers`, `VolunteerDetails` - View volunteer data
- `ExportVolunteersToPdf`, `ExportVolunteersToCSV` - Export
- **Authorization**: Superuser only

### Authorization Patterns
```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Superuser")]        // Superuser only
[Authorize(Roles = "NGO")]              // NGO only
[Authorize(Roles = "Volunteer")]        // Volunteer only
[Authorize]                             // Any authenticated user
[AllowAnonymous]                        // Public access
```

### üìù Action Items
- [ ] Read each controller file top to bottom
- [ ] Trace one complete flow: Volunteer applies ‚Üí NGO approves
- [ ] Identify where authorization checks happen
- [ ] Note how soft deletes work (IsActive flags)
- [ ] Check how file uploads work (NGO logos)

---

## üé® STEP 4: Understand the Views & User Interface (45 mins)

### Views Location: `/Views/`

#### Folder Structure
```
Views/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Account/          ‚Üí Login, Register, Manage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dashboard/        ‚Üí Superuser, Volunteer dashboards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Events/           ‚Üí Index, Details, Create, Edit, Delete
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Home/             ‚Üí Index (landing), Privacy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SuperAdmin/       ‚Üí Volunteers, VolunteerDetails
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ VolunteerApplications/ ‚Üí Apply, Index, Manage, ManageAll, Details
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Shared/           ‚Üí _Layout, _LoginPartial, Error
```

#### Key View Files to Study

**1. Shared/_Layout.cshtml**
- Main layout template (navbar, footer)
- Navigation changes based on user role
- Shows different menu items for Superuser/NGO/Volunteer

**2. Account/Register.cshtml**
- Registration form
- Role selection (NGO vs Volunteer)
- Additional fields for NGO users

**3. Events/Index.cshtml**
- Lists events
- Filters based on role:
  - Volunteers see public, active, upcoming events
  - NGOs see their own events
  - Superuser sees all events

**4. Events/Details.cshtml**
- Event information
- Apply button for volunteers
- Applications list for event owner (NGO)

**5. VolunteerApplications/Apply.cshtml**
- Application form (message, skills, availability)
- Validation to prevent duplicate/full event applications

**6. Dashboard/Superuser.cshtml**
- System-wide statistics
- Charts and graphs
- Recent activity

**7. Dashboard/Volunteer.cshtml**
- Personal application statistics
- Upcoming approved events
- Recent applications

#### View Components & Patterns
- **Razor Syntax**: `@model`, `@if`, `@foreach`, `@Html`, `@Url`
- **Tag Helpers**: `asp-controller`, `asp-action`, `asp-route-*`
- **Partial Views**: `_LoginPartial` for login/logout UI
- **ViewData/ViewBag**: Passing data from controller to view

### üìù Action Items
- [ ] Open `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` - understand the main template
- [ ] Review navigation logic in _Layout (how menus change by role)
- [ ] Study one complete CRUD flow: Events (Index ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Edit)
- [ ] Check form validation in views
- [ ] Look at how ViewModels are used (in `/Models/ViewModels/`)

}
```

**2. Apply Migrations**
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

**3. Run Application**
```bash
dotnet run
```

**4. Default Seed Accounts**
- **Superuser**: `superadmin@gmail.com` / Password from SeedData
- **NGO**: `ngo@example.com` / Password from SeedData
- **Volunteer**: `volunteer@example.com` / Password from SeedData

### Testing Workflow

#### Test Scenario 1: NGO Creates Event
1. Login as `ngo@example.com`
2. Navigate to Events ‚Üí Create New Event
3. Fill form and submit
4. Verify event appears in Events list

#### Test Scenario 2: Volunteer Applies
1. Login as `volunteer@example.com`
2. Browse Events ‚Üí Click event Details
3. Click "Apply" button
4. Fill application form and submit
5. Check "My Applications" to see status

#### Test Scenario 3: NGO Reviews Application
1. Login as `ngo@example.com`
2. Go to event Details
3. View applications list
4. Approve or Reject application with message

#### Test Scenario 4: Superuser Oversight
1. Login as `superadmin@gmail.com`
2. View dashboard statistics
3. Navigate to Volunteers section
4. Export data to PDF/CSV

#### Test Scenario 5: New NGO Registration
1. Logout
2. Register new account with NGO role
3. Login as new NGO ‚Üí See "Pending Approval" message
4. Login as Superuser ‚Üí Approve new NGO
5. Login as NGO again ‚Üí Can now create events

### What to Observe
- **Authorization**: Try accessing pages you shouldn't (e.g., Volunteer accessing NGO pages)
- **Validation**: Try submitting invalid data
- **Business Rules**: Try applying twice to same event, applying to full event
- **Soft Deletes**: Delete an event, check database (IsActive=false)
- **File Uploads**: Upload NGO logo, verify it appears

### üìù Action Items
- [ ] Set up database connection
- [ ] Run migrations
- [ ] Start application and login with all 3 roles
- [ ] Complete all 5 test scenarios
- [ ] Try breaking the rules (duplicate applications, etc.)
