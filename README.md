# KindConnect - Volunteer Management System

This is a role-based ASP.NET Core MVC application to connect NGOs with volunteers.

## Quick Start
- Ensure SQL Server is available and update `DefaultConnection` in `appsettings.json`.
- Run the application. On first start, seed data creates:
  - Superuser: `superadmin@gmail.com`
  - NGO: `ngo@example.com`
  - Volunteer: `volunteer@example.com`

## Project Workflow
See `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` for a complete explanation of the app flow, roles, and demo steps.
